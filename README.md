# Project Goals/Requirements
We need to develop two major packages

## Web Crawler Bot
BFS approach where for each link we want to explore links. 

We can start by crawling through pages like wikipedia but we need to find a way to find new websites that arent on our known list of sites

I will do some research.

## Search Engine
Search service to search through websites in our database. Maybe elasticsearch makes sense here because we will want to search by term
Elasticsearch has a reverse index which allows us to search by term
